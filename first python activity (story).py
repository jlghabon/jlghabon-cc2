Once upon a time, five travelers descended into the Earth to save the planet from lurking destruction. With their skills in socialization and charisma, they befriended all the factions in the Earth to help the travelers repel that 'destruction'. These five travelers were:
- {character_names[0]} wielded the mighty {equipment_names[0]}.
- {character_names[1]} possessed the {ability_names[1]} ability.
- {character_names[2]} carried the {item_names[2]}.
- {character_names[3]} protected the realm with the {equipment_names[3]}.
- {character_names[4]} harnessed the power of the {item_names[4]}.

And so, the story of these five travelers lived on after their departure, inspiring many generations to learn the story as an inspiration.
